# CS-400-Computer-Programming
This repository contains projects and assignments from CS 400.

The projects in this course were done in small, 4 person teams. Each person would be designated a specific role, Frontend Development, Backend Development, Data Wrangler, or Integration Manager. 

Each project has a README file which summarizes the projects specifics. 

Project 2 is especially notable because I pioneered the idea which lead to the project, and provided assitance to both the frontend and backend developers while completing my role as the data wrangler. 

Project 3 contains a video demonstrating its usage which can be found in the README file specific to that project.
(Project 3 has a demonstration because I was the integration manager for this project, and it was a part of our responsibities. For the other projects I took on different roles, and therefore, do not have demonstration videos for them)
